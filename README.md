# For Running the Server
path\termchat> cd server && cargo run

# For Running the Client
path\termchat> cd client && cargo run

# Login
Firstly, you need to log in to our server. For login, you need a user ID and password, which we have already mentioned. Therefore, you can enter the user ID and password. After successfully logging in, you will enter the start conversation section.

# Start Conversation
In the start conversation section, if you wish to communicate with another user, enter the receiver's user ID (name) of that user. If they are available, a connection will be established, allowing you to send messages to that user and exchange messages with each other.


# For Ending a Connection
If you wish to close or end the established connection, you can simply type the message "Bye" or "bye" in the message input section.
